### Hey ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack software engineer from Cochin.

I absorb and emits plenty of Javascript.

Electronics and fill in my spare time. I appreciate all forms of art, from picking a color for a  font to building a pond on the terrace. 

Apart from my gardening and crafts, I admire taking photographs of moments that anyone doesn't want to miss in a lifetime. 

I've worked for companies like Cubet Techno Labs, Bake Brand, Alts Solutions, and Guys Who Code.
